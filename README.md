## 🤔 About me:
I am a software developer who has completed the **42KL Core Program**, an alternative programming school emphasizing peer-to-peer and project-based learning. Through this program, I built a strong foundation in **C, C++, Git, web development,** and **peer-to-peer evaluations**. Beyond the program, I’ve actively participated in external projects, gaining exposure to diverse teams and fields while expanding my technical and interpersonal skills.

With an expertise in **UI/UX** and **frontend development**, I aim to contribute to your company through my attention to detail, adaptability, and passion for learning. I am also eager to grow in areas such as backend development, graphics, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, I bring **strong collaborative skills,** having worked with developers, cross-functional teams, and led team projects to deliver **impactful solutions**. I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my skills while driving value for your team.

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for a job and pursuing 42KL's specialisation program concurrently
- 💡 Fun fact: I know some Japanese 🗾 and play the electric guitar 🎸 for fun!
