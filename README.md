## About me:
Hello! I'm Rong Jie, a 42KL Cadet currently pursuing the 42's core programme. Currently, I'm still in the discovery stage in regards to learning computer science and programming, but currently I have done projects in C, learning C++, python and planning explore app development using Flutter in the future! I'm also currently working as a Figma designer on a gamified diet app (called Byte In) as a side project with my team.
